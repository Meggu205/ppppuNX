# ppppuNX
These particular ppppu edits are created using a combination of Flash Professional for asset creation and Flash Develop for coding and being responsible for the building of the swf. You can read about the workflow for this at http://www.flashdevelop.org/wikidocs/index.php?title=AS3:FlexAndFlashCS3Workflow

ppppuNX folder: What you're likely after. It's the templated based version of the minus8's ppppu flash.

Scripts: Contains useful jsfl scripts (used by Flash Professional) and a python script to reduce the more tedious work for the project. The design document goes into detail of what each script does and when it should be used.

as3test folder: Testing grounds for code too experimental to incorporate into ppppuNX. Useful to get an idea of how my scattered brain formed this thing. swfs files here may have bugs, be outdated in terms of code design, and not even work as intended so be aware of this.

If you wish to modify ppppuNX or the scripts, the only things I require is to not remove anyone from the credits. In addition, I respectfully ask that you make a fork on github for your changes so this project can get bigger and better.
