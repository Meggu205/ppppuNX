ppppuNX: what you're likely after. It's the templated based version of the minus8's ppppu flash.
Scripts: contains useful jsfl scripts and a python script to reduce the more tedious work.
as3test: Testing grounds for code too experimental to incorporate into ppppuNX. Useful to get an idea of how my scattered brain formed this thing.

If you wish to modify ppppuNX or the scripts, the only things I require is to keep me up to date so this thing can get bigger and better (which you can do at ppppuProgrammer.tumblr.com) and to not remove anyone from the credits.
